# blackjack
A blackjack project coded in Python. 

This is the first of a series of card games that I am aiming to code in Python. The idea is that these games will run in-terminal. Eventually, I hope to implement at GUI 
which will display graphics of the cards in terminal. 

This game can be played in the command line. I have decided to include suits and values instead of just values to allow me to experiment more with classes and more advanced Python techniques.
