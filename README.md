# blackjack
A blackjack project coded in Python. 

This is the first of a series of card games that I am aiming to code in Python. The idea is that these games will run in-terminal. Eventually, I hope to implement at GUI 
which will display graphics of the cards in terminal. 

This game can be played in the command line. I have decided to include suits and values instead of just values to allow me to experiment more with classes and more advanced Python techniques. 

Future plans for this project: I am hoping to develop a series of card games that run in terminal, I then want to tie them together and create a virtual in-terminal casino style game, where you have a certain number of points to start and can choose to play a range of games that can cause you to win or lose points!
